# Engineering to Series-A

I have worked at tech startups for 15 years, most of these were Software as a Service (SaaS) ventures.

Series-A is probably the most important point in the lifecycle of technology startups. Series-A means that you have validation for product-market fit and the investors now trust you to scale the business by acquiring new customers. In case of SaaS businesses, this necessitates scaling your engineering.

The success of your startup hinges on whether you can transform the engineering from pre-Series-A to post-Series-A. If you are doing this right, pre-Series-A engineering doesnâ€™t look anything like post-Series-A engineering.

In this talk, I intend to discuss some patterns that I have learned over the years to help this transformation. The content of this talk can be applied generally but will be presented in the context of a Python based stack.
